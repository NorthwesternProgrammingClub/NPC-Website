<h1>Northwestern Programming Club</h1> 
<body>
<p1>This is the future home page of the Northwestern Programming Club (NPC). </p1>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p> We are a group of aspiring programmers.</p>
<p> We hope to create a collaborative environment for students working on computer-related projects, homework, and assignments.</p>
<p> We strive to be a collective resource for those who do not have a lot of programming experience, but are interested in coding and want to get involved outside of the classroom.</p>
<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Established in 2015, the Northwestern Programming Club (NPC) was created after the founders noticed that there was a lack of a club on campus that promoted and encouraged programming to people of all skill levels.</p>
