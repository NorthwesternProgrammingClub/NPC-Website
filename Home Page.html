<h1>Northwestern Programming Club</h1> 
<body>
<p1>This is the future home page of the Northwestern Programming Club (NPC). </p1>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p> We are a group of aspiring programmers.</p>
<p> We hope to create a collaborative environment for students working on computer-related projects, homework, and assignments.</p>
<p> We strive to be a collective resource for those who do not have a lot of programming experience, but are interested in coding and want to get involved outside of the classroom.</p>
<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Established in 2015, the Northwestern Programming Club (NPC) was created after the founders noticed that there was a lack of a club on campus that promoted and encouraged programming to people of all skill levels.</p>
<h2>The Exec Board</h2>
<h4>Arnold Lee, President</h4>
<p>Arnold is the dear leader.</p>
<h4>Yingda Hu, Tech Chair</h4>
<p>Yingda is the smartest, dumbest guy you'll ever meet.</p>
<h4>Austin Tsao, Secretary</h4>
<p>An average guy in every way.</p>
<h4>Kevin Cheng, Noob</h4>
<p>Kevin is the best noob out there.</p>
<h4>Vincent Cheng, Public Affairs Chair</h4>
<p>Vincent joined the club for one reason only. (It's fairly obvious.)</p>
<h4>James He, Information Technology Chair</h4>
<p>The lead debugger, he'll help you debug code, if he's awake.</p>
